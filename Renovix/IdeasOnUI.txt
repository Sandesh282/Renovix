1. Improve on the UI of Cards... add some funky choosing animation like when the user slides the cards should resize dynamically and the 3d model should smoothly pop out.

2. There has to be cool splash screen giving intro of the app

3. Instead of having tabs like we had earlier use carousel in place of cards which will be more user intuitive.
4. also add a filter icon next to search bar.
5. Use better/custom icons
6.
